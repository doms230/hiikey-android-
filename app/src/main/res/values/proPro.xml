        the person created. If he/she has any private or exclusive events, then those events
        will be invisible to you if your not on their guest list. If this is your profile,
        than you\'ll have the option of deleting events, by tapping on the trash can.</string>

    <string name="profileguestmessage">Tapping on GUESTS will show you everyone on that person\'s guest list</string>

    <string name="profilehostmessage">Tapping on HOSTS will show you all of the people hosting that person.</string>

    <string name="profilehostermessage">Tapping the HOST BUTTON will ADD the person to your guest list.
    That means he/she will see all of your current and future private events. They will NOT be able
    to see your exclusive events unless invited first.</string>

    <string name="profilehostingmessage">Tapping the HOSTING BUTTON will REMOVE the person from your
    guest list and they will no longer be able to see any of your private or exclusive events.</string>
